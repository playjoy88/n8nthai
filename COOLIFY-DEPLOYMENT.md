# n8nThai - Coolify Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the n8nThai application on Coolify, a self-hostable Heroku/Netlify alternative.

## Prerequisites

- Coolify server set up and running
- Domain name configured and pointed to your Coolify server
- Basic understanding of Docker and container deployment
- Git repository with your n8nThai codebase

## Files Overview

We've created several files to facilitate deployment on Coolify:

1. `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for optimizing the Next.js application
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Defines all required services (app, PostgreSQL, Redis)
3. `.env.coolify` - Template for environment variables
4. Updated `next.config.js` - Optimized for production deployment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.coolify` to `.env` on your Coolify server or use Coolify's environment variable management:
   ```
   cp .env.coolify .env
   ```

2. Update all placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual configuration:
   - Generate secure passwords for `DB_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD`
   - Set proper JWT and NextAuth secrets
   - Configure your domain in all URL-related variables
   - Set up proper SMTP details for email notifications

### 2. Deploy using Coolify UI

#### Option A: Direct Repository Deployment (Recommended)

1. Log in to your Coolify dashboard
2. Click "Create New Resource" â†’ "Application"
3. Select your Git provider and repository
4. Choose "Docker Compose" as the deployment method
5. Select the `docker-compose.yml` file in your repository
6. Configure environment variables (import from `.env.coolify`)
7. Configure build and deployment settings:
   - Build command: `docker-compose build`
   - Start command: `docker-compose up -d`
8. Click "Deploy"

#### Option B: Manual Docker Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually or need more control:

1. SSH into your Coolify server
2. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd n8nthai
   ```
3. Create an `.env` file from your template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.coolify .env
   ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration
5. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### 3. Database Migration

After successful deployment, you need to run Prisma migrations:

```bash
# Connect to the running container
docker exec -it n8nthai-app /bin/sh

# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed the database if needed
npx prisma db seed
```

This can also be added as a post-deployment script in Coolify.

## Persistent Data

The Docker Compose configuration includes volumes for:

- PostgreSQL data: `postgres-data`
- Redis data: `redis-data`
- n8n instance templates: `instance-volume`
- Uploads: `./uploads:/app/uploads`

Ensure these volumes are backed up regularly.

## SSL Configuration

Coolify typically handles SSL termination automatically. If you're using the included NGINX configuration (commented out in docker-compose.yml), you'll need to:

1. Create a `nginx` directory
2. Add configuration files:
   - `nginx.conf`
   - `conf.d/default.conf`
3. Set up SSL certificates in the `nginx/ssl` directory

## Monitoring

Monitor your application using:

- Coolify's built-in monitoring tools
- Container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Application logs: Check the Next.js logs in the container

## Scaling

For scaling the n8nThai application:

1. Adjust resources in Coolify dashboard
2. For database scaling:
   - Consider managed PostgreSQL service
   - Set up replication for high availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection issues**:
   - Verify PostgreSQL service is running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Check connection string in environment variables
   - Ensure database password is correct

2. **Redis connection issues**:
   - Verify Redis service is running
   - Check Redis password in environment variables

3. **Application not starting**:
   - Check container logs: `docker-compose logs n8nthai`
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check for build errors in Coolify logs

4. **n8n instances not working**:
   - Verify `INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_PATH` is correctly mounted
   - Check instance service logs
   - Ensure ports are properly configured

## Updates and Maintenance

To update your application:

1. Push changes to your Git repository
2. Coolify will automatically detect changes and trigger a new deployment
3. Or manually trigger redeployment in the Coolify dashboard

For major updates:

1. Consider creating a separate staging environment first
2. Test thoroughly before updating production
3. Have a rollback plan ready

## Support

If you encounter issues with the deployment:

1. Check Coolify documentation
2. Review Docker and Next.js deployment guides
3. Refer to n8nThai documentation
